        <h1><u>Faceless</u></h1>
        
        <div></div>
        <h3>Collection One is made up of two different types of drawing, both contain faceless figures. The majority of them are simple line drawings which mirror Starkweather’s own life: a man in jail, a woman being led guarded by a cop, a man and a woman in a car, and figures carrying guns. They seem to be drawings of Starkweather’s own memories which have astonishing psychological implications. Why are the figures faceless? Is it an attempt to dissociate from reality? To dehumanize himself, Caril, the victims, and the people around them? These more abstract drawings are the only drawings in the collection whose content links directly to Starkweather’s killing spree, although there is a drawing of a man, presumably a self portrait, holding a gun drawn in a more realistic style. It seems that Starkweather can’t bring himself to fully draw in the details of this period, fill in the lines, see the faces, and look into the eyes of himself, Caril, or the victims. Some of the figures even have eyebrows or something hinting at the shape of an eye, but never true eyes. We only have these drawings through photographs, presumably taken by or for Reinhardt when he was working with Starkweather on his autobiography. The last two drawings of the collection are original and are much more formless, only displaying a vaguely humanoid figure with a head and shoulders. They are both drawn on what seems to be colored scrap paper. All images of the drawings, both scanned and photographs, are of materials currently housed in the University of Lincoln, Nebraska Special Archives.

        <img src="SC_%234.jpg" id= "photo1"/>
        <div id="div01"></div>
        <div><p>Photograph of a pencil drawing. The setting or background of the drawing is of two barely shaped walls meeting at a door. There are three figures, two officers standing on either side of a woman. The officer on the left is only half shown and has their back turned. The officer on the right is facing forward with their head turned slightly towards the woman. The woman stands at the center, directly in front of the open door with her hands on the door jamb to either side. She wears a ponytail or perhaps a head scarf. Back of the photograph is blank.</p></div>
        <div><h5><i>A simple figure drawing seems to have taken place, as if from memory. Two police men are booking a young woman with what could be a scarf around her neck. During Starkweather and Fugate's arrest, Fugate also wore a scar wrapped around her head.</i></h5></div>
        <h5><i>According to Reinhardt in</i> The Murderous Trail of Charles Starkweather<i>, Stakweather believed he was less than a month from being executed when he drew this picture.</i></h5>
        <div id="div1"></div>
        <div>
            <img src="SC_%235.jpg" id="photo2"/>
        </div>
        <div id="div02"></div>
        <div><p>Photograph of a pencil drawing. Depicts three figures in the midst of motion, as well as the left headlight of a vehicle. The vehicle peeks out at the bottom left of the page besides a figure holding a shotgun. Only the bottom left figure’s head and shoulders are shown. This figure is firing at the far right figure who is slouched as if struck with a bullet. The figure in the center is walking away with their backs to the viewer and the assailant and holding a shotgun. Back of the photograph is blank.</p></div>
        <h5><i>Another possible depiction of the killing spree. The figure shooting maybe Fugate, as it has longer hair. I may even be a replication of their murder of Merle Collison as Starkweather claimed that his gun jammed, giving way for Fugate to shoot him.</i></h5>
        <h5><i>The drawing appears in the newspapre article "The Criminal Mind: This Boy Killed Eleven." See the <a href="newspaper_page.xhtml" class="a">Articles Page</a>.</i></h5>

        <img src="SC_%238.jpg" id= "photo3" />
        <div id="div03"></div>
        <div><p>Photograph of a pencil drawing. Depicts a jail cell door with a figure holding the bars of the doors with both hands. The figure has glasses and a pompadour style hair style. They are wearing a prison uniform. Back of the photograph is blank.</p></div>
        <h5><i>Most likely a self portrait of Starkweather being locked up in prison. The hair and the glasses are huge indicators that this could be Starkweather himself. Even the furrowed brow and the position he’s in, gives the audience a feeling of hatred for where he is.</i>

            <div id="div04"></div>
        <div><p>Photograph of a pencil drawing. Depicts two figures in a vehicle facing the left of the page. The figure on the left side of the vehicle is facing the driver. The driver of the vehicle is leaning forward against a steering wheel, almost outside of the windshield and right door. Back of the photograph is blank.</p></div>
        <h5><i>Another basic figure drawing of two figures in an older vehicle. One is leaning outside of the car’s frame, as if to indicate being hurt. The passenger looks on, but is not moving away from the car. Seemingly another reenactment of his spree, a drawing of him and Fugate.</i></h5>
        <div id="div4"></div>
        <img src="SC_%2311.jpg" id= "photo5"/>
            <div id="div05"></div> 
        <div><p>Photograph of a pencil drawing. Man sits in a chair in front of a desk and what looks to be a barred window. He has a pencil in his hand, writing or drawing on a piece of paper. He also has something is his mouth, probably a cigarette because of his hand placement and how there are faint lines of smoke around his head. Back of the photograph is blank.</p></div>
        <h5><i>If the man in the drawing is indeed meant to be Charles Starkweather himself, it could be inferred that this is a depiction of Starkweather writing the manuscript for his autobiography. That same manuscript that was sent to James Melvin Reinhardt and then asked to be returned in multiple letters. See <a href="Biography Page.html" class="a">The Story Page</a>.</i></h5>
        <div id="div5"></div>
        <div>
            <img src="SC_%2316.jpg" id= "photo6"/></div>
            <div id="div06"></div> 
        </div><div><p>Photograph of a pencil drawing of a man and a woman in a car. The figures have little detail or depth and are more of an outline. The
            eyes are only implied by eyebrows. The car also is not fully drawn and the front is
            open-faced so that you can see the full length of the figures. The man sits at the
            wheel of the car, his foot on the gas pedal. The woman sits with
            one arm across the back of the seat and the other holding a rifle across her lap.
            Back of the photograph is blank.
        </p></div>
        <h5><i>TWhat is interesting here is that the woman in the drawing is the one in possession of the gun. When Starkweather and Fugate were caught, Fugate claimed that she was forced into the whole thing and that she had not actively shot anyone. Starkweather, however, insisted that Fugate did actively participate in the  killing and even argued that Fugate enjoyed it. While the police never fully confirmed what really happened there was some evidence and witness reports that Fugate did play a larger role in the killings than she claimed.</i></h5>

        <img src="SC_%236.jpg" id= "photo7"/>

        <div><p>Pencil drawing on blue paper. A lined rectangle takes up a majority of the drawing. A silhouette of something, whether it’s a person or landscape is in the center of the drawing. In both the silhouette and the rectangle has a two lines that cross in it, away from the viewer. To the right of the rectangle is an arrow pointing down at a line. Back of the drawing has pencil-drawn lines</p></div>
        <h5><i>According to Reinhardt in</i> The Murderous Trail of Charles Starkweather<i>, Starkweather often dreamed about death. Starkweather drew this during one of his interviews with Starkweather. The picture “represents Charles Starkweather's conception of ‘how Death looked’ when ‘she’ came repeatedly to the window of his small sleeping room just before dawn.” Starkweather drew this during one of his interviews with Starkweather.</i></h5>

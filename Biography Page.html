        <h1>The Story</h1>
        
        <div><p>Charles Raymond Starkweather was born on November 24th, 1938 in Lincoln, Nebraska. He was the third child of seven to his parents, Guy and Helen Starkweather. Growing up in Nebraska he attended Saratoga Elementary School, Irving Junior High School, and Lincoln High School. Starkweather was born with genu varum, a birth defect which caused bow leggedness. This defect coupled with his speech impediment led to peers and classmates bullying Starkweather throughout his academic carreer. He eventually dropped out in 1856, his senior year. That same year, an 18 year old Starkweather met 13 year old Caril Ann Fugate as the newspaper warehouse he worked at was across the street from her Junior High.</p></div>
            
          
            
            <div><p>On November 30th, 1957 a service station attendant named Robert Colvert refused to sell Starkweather a stuffed animal on credit. Starkweather returned to service station with a shotgun, stealing $100 from the till, and forcing Colvert into his vehicle. He drove Colvert to a remote location where he killed him with several gun shots.</p></div> 
            
            <div><p>On January 21st, 1958 Starkweather arrived at Fugate’s home where her mother, Velda Bartlett, and step father, Marion Bartlett, told him to stay away from Caril. He fatally shot the two of them and clubbed their 2 year old daughter, Caril’s hald sister, Betty Jean Bartlett to death. Starkweather claimed Caril was present for the murders, allowing for them to occer, even participating. Caril denied this stating when she arrived home, Starkweather met her with a gun and stated that her family was only being held hostage. She said that he told her to cooperate and her family would be safe. Police arrived to the grizzly scene on Janurary 27th.</p></div>
            
            <div><p>Leaving the house in a stolen vehicle, Starkweather and Fugate drove to the house of a Bartlett family friend, August Meyer, who lived in Bennet, Nebraska. Starkweather killed Meyer, as well as his dog with a shotgun.</p></div>
            
            <div><p>After fleeing the area, the two got the stolen car stuck in the mud, and eventually abandoned it. Two teenagers, Robert Jensen and Carol King, found the two on the rode and offered to give them a ride. Starkweather seized the vehicle, driving to an abandoned storm cellar in Bennet where he shot Jensen, and attempted to rape King, but failed to do so, he fatally shot her as well. Starkweather admitted in court to shooting Jensen but claimed it was Fugate who actually shot King. She denied the accusation saying she had stayed in the car the entire time.</p></div>
            
            <div><p>The pair fled Bennett in the stolen car, driving to a wealthy suburb of Lincoln, where they broke into the home of industrialist C. Lauer Ward, and his wife Clara. Upon entering Starkweather stabbed thier maid Ludmila “Lilyan” Fencl to death, then waited the arrival of Laurer and Clara. Starkweather broke the neck of the Ward family dog so to not alert the Ward’s of his presence. Clara arrived home first, alone, only to be stabbed to death. Starkweather claimed although he attempted to through a knife at Clara, it was Fugate who stabbed her numerous times. When Lauer Ward finally arrived home, he was shot by Starkweather. Fugate and Starkweather robbed the home, stealing jewlery and Ward’s black 1956 Packard, leaving Nebraska.</p></div> 
            
        <div><p>Following the murders of the Wards and Fencl, the Lincoln community was outraged and deemed the Lincoln Police Department incompetant as they has been unable to capture Starkweather and Fugate.</p></div> 
            
        <div><p>After Ward’s Packard had been identified, Fugate and Starkweather came upon Merle Collison sleeping in his Buick along the highway outside of Douglas, Wyoming. He was fatally shot. Starkweather claimed that Fugate had been the one to shoot Collison, after his gun had jammed. Claiming Fugate was “the most trigger happy person” he had ever met.</p></div>
            
        <div><p>Collison had a parking brake which was new to Starkweather, as he attempted to flee the scene the car stalled. Passing the couple, geologist Joe Sprinked stopped to help them. Starkweather threatened him with a rifle and the two fought for the gun. Simultaneously Natrona County Sheriff’s Deputy, William Romer, arrived. Seeing the police arrive, Fugate ran to him, screaming something to the effect of “It’s Starkweather! He’s going to kill me.”</p></div>
            
        <div><p>Winning the altercation Sprinkly escaped with his life as Starkweather drove off initiating a car chase with three officers. A bullet fired by Sheriff Earl Heflin hit Starkweather, causing deep bleeding, which led him to surrender.</p></div> 
            
        <div><p>Sheriff Earl Heflin later stated “He thought he was bleeding to death. That’s why he stopped. That’s the kind of yellow son of a bitch he is.”</p></div>
            
        <div><p>Starkweather was extradited from Wyoming to Nebraska. He believed that either state would execute him, he did not know however that Wyoming’s governor at the time was greatly opposed to the death penalty.</p></div> 
            
        <div><p>Changing his story multiple times, initially claiming Fugate has nothing to do with the murders, to eventually claiming she shared an equal role in the murder spree. Fugate claimed during the entirety of the sentence that she did not participate in the crimes whatsoever, only staying with him to ensure the safety of her family. However Judge Harry Spencer did not believe Fugate, as he believe she has multiple opportunities to escape.</p></div> 
            
        <div><p>Starkweather never stated remorse, and appeared indifferent about his possible death. On May 23, 1958 Starkweather was sentenced to death and was executed by electric chair at the Nebraska State Penitentiary in Lincoln, Nebraska on June 25, 1959. Starkweather is buried in Wyuka Cemetary, along with five of his victims.</p></div> 
            
        <div><p>Fugate was convicted as an accomplice and recieved a life sentence on November 21, 1958. She was paroled in June 1976 after serving only 17 years. She later settled in Michigan, where she still resides.

<h1>Starkweather and Reinhardt</h1>
        <p>James Melvin Reinhardt was a criminology and sociology professor at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln from 1931-1963. While Starkweather was in prison, Reinhardt took an interest and briefly became Starkweather’s editor on his autobiography. This is how Reinhardt came to acquire copies of Starkweather’s manuscripts and quite a few of Starkweather’s drawings which now reside in the University of Nebraska-Lincoln Libraries Archives 	
&#38; Special Collections and are displayed on this website. Later the relationship between the two soured, as shown in the letters below. These letters were written by Starkweather to Reinhardt and are also currently within the University of Nebraska-Lincoln Libraries Archives & Special Collections. While Reinhardt does write about the drawings in his book <i>The Murderous Trail of Charles Starkweather</i>, he does not go into an in-depth analysis, and many of the drawing are not included.

      <p>I appreciate the fact that you wanted to edit my life story for me. but i can not

         us come to a disliking point in the near future. i would please like to have all of
         my manuscript return and i'm sorry if you have spent to much time on it, and if is

      <p>I appreciate the fact that you have paid attention to my family and myself in the
         past but that does not give you an excuse for not returning my manuscript.</p>
      
      <p>On Feb. 7, 1959 you made a <span class="red">RELEASE</span>
        with my family releasing you from any previous agreements, also that release specified
         very clearly that you had no further interest or jurisdiction containing to that of
         my three chapters of my manuscripts which is now in your possession. You have informed
         us perviously [sic] that you had two typed, word for word copies made which should
         be sufficient to you, and which i nor the family have not disapprove of, but the release
         also clearly specified that you have no more need for my manuscript, and my family
         and i can not under-stand why you well [sic] not return the original script as you
         promised to do so at the close of the "Parade Magazin" publication on March 15, 1959.
         I wrote you a letter a few weeks before the Parade made these publication, stating
         that my desire was to have the manuscript return. And in reply, you told my family
         that you didn't have to return it until <span class="red">(</span>30 days.<span class="red">)</span>. i assure you Mr. Reinhardt them 30 days have lapsed quite abit [sic]. I have quite abit [sic]
         of doubt in your character at this time. You have insisted to my family and myself
         several times that you're an honorable, trustworthy and a true–to–your–word person,
         but in my mind, there's doubt, but i insist on proof that you are what you say you

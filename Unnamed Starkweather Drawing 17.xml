            <figDesc>Drawing of a woman standing in what looks to be someth sort of lobby or perhaps the living room of a home. She's elegantly dressed in a floor length dress and heels, looking directly at the observer. Her posture leans lazily back and her mouth is slightly open. The background is extremely detailed unlike many of Starkweather's other drawings. There's some sort of short brick wall behind her and to the right with a bottle, a book, and some other unidentifiable odds and ends. The floor itself looks to be stone and there are steps leading down into a seating area that has a variety of couches, tables, and desks. Back of the drawing has some numbers on it. Top left reads #1, bottom center-left reads 633, bottom left reads 2, bottom left-center reads 203/4, and botrom center reads 26.</figDesc>

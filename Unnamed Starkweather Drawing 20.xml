            <figDesc>Pencil drawing of a head of a woman, most likely of Caril Ann Fugate. The head is bent forward slightly and turned towards the observer. Her hair is dark and curles in a short hairstyle. It looks like he is wearing lipstick. There is a little shading in the face and her eyes look a little crazed, wide with the pupils not quite matching up. Her mouth is open as if she is about to talk. Back of the drawing has a circled five in the bottom left corner.</figDesc>

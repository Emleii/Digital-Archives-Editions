        <h1>Value Statement</h1>
        <div><p>The subject of Charles Starkweather is a rather sensitive one since he is an infamous figure in Nebraska history who has taken many innocent lives. Due to this, it is important to reflect on how this research could impact the community and think carefully about why we—Kaylen and Emma—are making the decisions we are making.</p></div>
        
        <div><p>Archiving is inherently a process done in relation with many different individuals/groups and that these relationships should be kept at the forefront of our minds. And it is not a soulless endeavor and it has a direct impact on the emotions and well-being of other people. This is true for both those who have interacted with the materials and are now dead and the living who, in some contexts, are the survivors.</p></div>
        
        <div><p> Why, out of all other topics, did we choose to focus on Starkweather, and are there any downsides? There is often a dark fascination with serial killers, but is that something that should be encouraged? By studying him, do we give him some recognition, a form of immortality and fame? Does a person who has killed so many innocents deserve such a thing? People often wonder that if attention is what these killers want, does studying them in this manner encourage serial killings in the future? We’ll be honest, we didn’t think that deeply about these questions prior to choosing our topic, but it is very important to learn to ask them.</p></div>

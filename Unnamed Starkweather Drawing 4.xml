To the far left of the photo, only the right half of figure is shown wearing what appears to be a police uniform. They appear to have their back to the drawing. To the far right appears to be another officer facing forward in the drawing. The center of the drawing depicts a woman facing the far left officer. She appears to have a pony tail and her right hand leans against the wall. Back of the scan is blank.</figDesc>

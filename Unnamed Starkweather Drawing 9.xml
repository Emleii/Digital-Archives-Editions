Infront of the bushy pine trees is two large chunks of tree wood on both sides of the drawing as well as tall grass sections. While in the foreground the drawing has two horses and atop the right horse a figure who appears to be a cowboy.The cowboy is leaning down slightly toward the horse, holding the horses lead with both hands, while holding a cigarette in his mouth. The horse on the left, without a rider, is equipped with a saddle. Back of the scan is blank.</figDesc>

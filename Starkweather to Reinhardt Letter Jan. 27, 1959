            <salute>Dear Mr. Reinhardt:</salute>
        </opener>

        <p>I appreciate the fact that you wanted to edit my life story for me. but i can not agree to the way in which your going about it. so to keep from having feelings between us come to a disliking point in the near future. i would please like to have all of my manuscript return and i'm sorry if you have spent to much time on it, and if is cost you any trouble, and i assure you the money you have invested up to date, <hi style="font-weight:bold;">well [sic] be paid to you in full.</hi></p>
        <p>Please return immediately to me at the Nebraska State Penitentiary <hi style="font-weight:bold;">all containing parts</hi>of the <hi style="font-weight:bold;">original,</hi> and <hi style="font-weight:bold;">copies</hi> of the following chapters &#8211; 1, <hi style="font-weight:bold;">2</hi> and &#8211;<hi style="font-weight:bold;">3</hi> of my manuscript. <hi style="font-weight:bold;">Also</hi>, in your possession, you have three, <hi style="font-weight:bold;">(3)</hi> large pictures, plus six, <hi style="font-weight:bold;">(6)</hi> small pictures, which are hand drawn by myself, and i wish those nine <hi style="font-weight:bold;">(9) in all.</hi> pictures are also return immediately along with the manuscript.</p>
        <p>I'm not going to sell my story to no body, i'm a little disgusted over the headaches it's caused, but i hope to remain writing on it, and maybe we'll be able to get together on it later one, <hi style="font-weight:bold;">but not at this time..</hi></p>
        <space></space>
        <p>Please return my manuscript, and pictures. at once, i'm impatiently waiting for their return, and as you well know my time is very limited.</p>

        <closer>
            <salute>Thank you&#8212;</salute>
            <salute>Yours truely</salute>

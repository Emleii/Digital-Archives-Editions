        <p>"Did Starkweather understand the enormity of his situation?" Scheele Asked.</p>
        <p>"I believe he did and knew the consequences for the acts he committed," Dr. Coats replied.</p>
        <p>Dr. Coats said he does not believe Starkweather to be a fit person for placing in the State Hospital.</p>
        <p>At this point in the testimony, Gaughan objected when Scheele asked Coats if patients have escaped from the hospital.</p>
        <p>Judge Harry Spence sustained the objection and termed the question "improper" and instructed the jury to disregard the question.</p>
        <p>Dr. Coats also testified he does not believe Starkweather has a "diseased or defective mind."</p>
        <p>"But another person in your profession might disagree," Gaughan said on cross examination.</p>
        <p>"That's right," Dr. Coats said.</p>
        <p>Munson said he does not believe the mere fact 1 person kills another is an indication of insanity.</p>
        <p>The psychologist said he considers himself "an impartial witness" but said he was asked by the prosecution to test Starkweather.</p>
        <p>The clinical psychologist said that is abnormal but not necessarily insane, for 1 man to kill others.</p>
        <p>On cross examination by Defense Atty. T. Clement Gaughan, Munson said he believes that Starkweather's claims he does not trust people are a "crust to hide his feelings."</p>
        <p>Gaughan questioned the psychologist at length in an attempt to get Munson to say that it is not sane for 1 man to kill a number of persons.</p>
        <p>Munson replied that "it can be sane under certain circumstances" although "I've never heard of anybody killing that many people.</p>

      <div class="editor_note">
        <p><i>EDITOR’S NOTE &#8212; What drove convicted killer Charles Starkweather to one of the bloodiest forays in recent criminal history? A widely known author and lecturer on criminal behavior, Dr. James Melvin Reinhardt, professor of criminology at the University of Nebraska, sums up the case after interviewing the youth, his family, friends and teachers, and after watching him in court.</i></p>
      </div>
      
        <div class="section">
         <p><b>By DR. J. M. REINHARDT</b></p>
         <p>LINCOLN. Nebr., (AP)&#8212;Charles Starkweather, the 19-year-old killer, has reached the end of the line.</p>
         <p>Of 11 slayings he has admitted, he was convicted of one. But he awaits with indifference the day of his execution.</p>
        <p>His cell will open to the electric chamber. It is well lighted and ventilated. Prom a barred window he can see an arch of sky above the prison yard. He can watch the sun go down, but he cannot see it rise.</p>
        <p>Charles Starkweather terrified a city. He put a stop to laughter, made people fearful to step out of doors. He fixed his name in criminal history.</p>
        <p>What made him kill?</p>
        <p>I watched Starkweather during his trial. I talked with family and friends. I had a private, unmonitored, three-hour conversation with him in prison. Out of this, some of his life’s values became evident, some conclusions could be drawn.</p>
        <p>The answer to why he killed must be found inside Charles Starkweather, in his way of looking at life, in the values he gave it.</p>
        <p>He is the third of seven children&#8212;six boys and a girl. He grew up in a law-abiding family, knew good public schools and libraries.</p>
        </div>
   
        <div class="section">
        <h4>A Normal Childhood</h4>
        <p>His earlier years were not markedly different on the surface from that of thousands of young people who have grown into respectable adulthood. He shared the companionship of the family dog, often went hunting with his older brothers and his father, spent week ends with August Meyer of Bennet, a family friend whom he later murdered.</p>
        <p>For a number of years he attended church and Sunday school regularly, but lost interest before he finished the eighth grade. He said "I just got tired of it.”</p>
        <p>Charles Starkweather’s school intelligence rating was dull normal. Both the psychologists for the defense and the prosecution put his intelligence in the normal range.</p>
        <p>The hideous eruption did not break suddenly out of a tranquil past. The provoking incidents came quickly, but the destructive forces were already there, waiting.</p>
        <p>They had been quietly building up for years. Charles himself was not aware of what was really going on inside of him.</p>
        <p>The exterior bristled and withdrew. Nobody gave it a thought.</p>
        <p>All the time the inside of him was watching fences go up that he couldn't cross, gates closed that he couldn’t open.</p>
        <p>In his job at a printing plant, he said, people were “looking down on me.”</p>
        <p>I said, “Why didn’t you stay with your brother? He has made a living and stayed out of trouble.”</p>
        <p>He said: “You think I wanted to be a garbage hauler ... who gives a damn for a garbage hauler?”</p>
        <p>For Charles, life’s purposes had no scope. Egoistic and biologic satisfactions, that was about all. A girl to use, a gun to shoot, and power that could be tasted.</p>
        <p>Whatever the provocative incidents that set Charles Starkweather off on the killing rampage. the inhibited, remorseless, power-hungry ego was already there.</p>
        <p>It had’ been nursed in a multitude of grotesque and cruel fantasies. It was unfolded in his language and manner in the interview.</p>
        <p>When I asked him for an explanation of his killings, he could say only: “The old man came at me ... I had to kill him ... the old lady was coming at me with a knife ... she wanted to break up me and Caril ... the little girl was crying ...”</p>
        <p>Killing not only served his immediate ends, it symbolized the destruction of opposing forces.</p>
        <p>Behind his hunger for the feel of power was a cowering sense of failure. The gun could do things in a hurry.</p>
        <p>He had thrilled to its performances on the television screen. He had watched himself handle it in the mirror.</p>
        <p>As far back as Charles could remember he wanted to be important.</p>
        <p>He had acquired numerous personal oddities and mannerisms to shield his sense of inadequacy: a withdrawn look, tricks for maintaining social distance—like refusing to answer, appearing not to hear, keeping silent.</p>
        <p>“Talk gets you nowhere," he said.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h4>Realistic Day Dreams</h4>
        <p>Beneath these exterior safety devices were fantasy scenes of cruelty and personal mastery. These images had become more impelling and complex with time. They seemed so vividly realistic at times that he came up with</p>
        <p>He did not always know whether he was asleep or awake.</p>
        <p>For years it did not occur to him that one day he would break over these fantasies to become a real murderer. Even after the first murder which he admittedly committed for money “so that he and Caril could run away,” he confessed a return to the murderous images.</p>
        <p>Except for the murder of the filling station attendant for money, the killings were planless. His victims simply “got in the way.”</p>
        <p>He told me he “could never stop pulling the trigger” until the last cartridge was spent. It was humiliating to “miss the head.”</p>
        <p>The boy Robert Jensen, for whose murder Charles was convicted. was shot six times in and around the right ear.</p>
        <p>The gun was a poor defeated ego’s short road to power.</p>
        <p>Power over others: that is what he Wanted. This was the ego’s answer to real or imaginary wrongs.</p>
        <p>A former schoolmate had felt sorry for him at school, "he seemed so lonely.” She invited him to her house, introduced him to her parents, tried to help him with his math. Within the week, Charles was saying she was “my girl”and the other boys “had better stay away from her.” The girl had to drop him cold.</p>
        <p>As we talked at the prison. Charles said he loved Caril and had to hold on to her at all costs. “Caril and I got along fine together ... she does everything that I want,” he said.</p>
        <p>Caril Ann Fugate, 14, accompanied Starkweather on his killing rampage. She also has been charged with murder and awaits trial.</p>
        <p>Charles Starkweather was powerless to see the world as others see it, powerless to measure himself by the standards others use.</p>
        <p>He was upset because he was forbidden to wear his cowboy boots to the trial. Day after day he showed up with his flaming red hair trickily groomed. At his preliminary hearing he was more interested in his tie than in the charge against him.</p>
        <p>In the courtroom, he was unmoved by the tears of the slain boy’s father. His eyes followed the faces of the jury with intriguing curiosity as they looked at the picture of the nude, mutilated body of one of his victims. His muscles tightened with anger when his counsel sought to establish his mental incompetence.</p>
        <p>He smiled occasionally when he spoke to his mother.</p>
        <p>He appeared always aware of his own importance in the courtroom. After all Charles Starkweather was what it was all about.</p>
        <p>When I told him that the insanity plea was perhaps his only and last dim chance, he replied: “I would rather burn.”</p>
        <p>He resisted the determination of his attorneys to use the insanity plea to the last. His ego could find nothing hard or cold or nerve testing about the cruelties of an insane man.</p>
        <p>He had shot his way into the annals of crime. For him this was not something to be bartered away for “the rest of my life in a stinkin’ asylum.”</p>
        <p>It is difficult to find where society failed in this case.</p>
        <p>His flaming red hair, arched legs and short stature invited nicknames like “BowLegs,” “Pint.” “Firefly,” “Archie.” One student said he looked like he was born riding a barrel.</p>
        <p>For a time in school he had a lisp in his speech that apparently had an inhibiting effect 'upon his behavior.</p>
        <p>Many another boy has overcome far more serious handicaps.</p>
        <p>Charles’ interest in school was sporadic and unsustained. He did well in some subjects, poorly in others.</p>
     </div>

     <div class="section">
        <h4>Had Artistic Talent</h4>
        <p>A teacher who knew him well said that he had an artistic turn of mind and could have become an artist if that interest could have been cultivated. He liked to make things with his hands.</p>
        <p>On Christmas and other special occasions, he spent endless hours helping the teachers make flowers and decorations.</p>
        <p>His only sister LaVeta was 16 when her brother set out with his 14-year-old girl friend to shoot his way to “glory.” LaVeta has wistful eyes and a winsome face.</p>
        <p>LaVeta, he said, “is my special sister. I Wish I could have painted her face just like it is.”</p>
        <p>It was the only face that could hold his attention long enough to finish the picture, although he did experiment with other subjects &#8212; wood scenes and animals.</p>
        <p>His father reports: “He would be sitting painting a picture as if unconscious of everything around him, then suddenly he would look up. flip his pencil at somebody and walk out.”</p>
        <p>His father is a little taller, a little heavier and a little better looking than the average middle-aged American male. He is a carpenter by trade and has had a vacillating work record for the past 12 years.</p>
        <p>He has been visited recurringly with a mild arthritic ailment since 1946. His manner is un- conventional, demonstrative and sometimes shocking.</p>
        <p>After his condemned son was led from the courtroom for the last time and while the mother wept alone, he said: “I’d like to go out and have a steak dinner.”</p>
        <p>Yet in his case this is not the mark of a man without feeling. It is an unerring sign that tension has softened. He never exhibited to me any evidence of cold indifference.</p>
        <p>In his own words: “I have spent sleepless nights ... wondering ... wishing for an answer ... thinking about the people Charles has killed...."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h4>His Mother's Character</h4>
        <p>Charles Starkweather's mother is pretty. She is small. Her face looks tired and sad but no older than her years.</p>
        <p>One neighbor said, “She works all the time. When not working away from home, she is ironing, sewing, washing or something."</p>
        <p>From a teacher: “The parents have always co-operated with the school. They almost never miss a school function or a parent-teacher meeting.”</p>
        <p>Another teacher: "They are poor, and don't have as good clothes as some children, but they are always clean."</p>
        <p>None of the teachers thought that Charles' brothers or his sister had been a disciplinary problem in school. One said: "They are better than the average."</p>
        <p>A neighbor told me that the Starkweather children “are very nice and considerate. They never run through my house and never come in without being invited even if the door is open."</p>
        <p>Charles’ two older brothers are respectable, self-supporting law-abiding citizens. The Starkweather house is small and old and run down, out of place in the center of an attractive middle class neighborhood where it sits.</p>
        <p>Such is the family and the home of Charles Starkweather.</p>
        <p>Charles Starkweather had some laudable interests. Under the sustained stimulus of appropriate social rewards, these might have been turned to constructive ends.</p>
        <p>But he turned to guns.</p>
        <p>His only plaint after the sentence was that his attorneys had “tried me for all those murders instead of the one I was charged with.”</p>
        <p>He said that he thought he should have a new trial, but “I would be glad to go to the chair tomorrow if I could have Caril on my lap."</p>

        <p><i>Starkweather drawing, made in prison cell, may be wishful thinking. His art work showed some talent, teachers say, although he never took lessons. His parents urged him to attend art school. Starkweather says now he wishes he had studied art but his real ambition was to run a chicken farm.</i></p>  
        <h4>Starkweather scoreboard: seven days of terror</h4> 
        <p>In seven days last year, Charles Starkweather, 19, and slim Caril Ann Fugate, 14, left a bloody trail from Lincoln, Neb., to Casper, Wyo. When they finally were captured, the box score stood: 10 dead (six shootings, two stabbings, one beating and one combination stabbing-shooting).</p>    
        <p>After their capture, Starkweather also confessed killing a service station attendant, Robert Colvert, two months before.</p>  
        <p>The trail began at Caril's home in a Lincoln suburb. Apparently because they forbade him to see Caril further, Starkweather shot her stepfather, Marion Bartlett and her mother, Velda. Also brutally beaten to death was Caril's 2 1/2-year-old stepsister, Betty Jean.</p>
        <p>Charles hid the bodies in outbuildings, fled to the farm of August Meyer, a Starkweather family friend, shot him. Escaping, his car got stuck in a mud road. When teenagers Robert Jensen and Carol King offered to help, Jensen was shot, Carol shot and stabbed. The pair fled back to Lincoln, holed up in the fashionable home of businessman Lauer Ward. Ward was shot his wife and their maid stabbed.</p>
        <p>On the run again, Caril and Charles reached Douglas, Wyo. Shoe salesman Merle Collison, shot as he slept in his car, was the last victim. Moments later, Charles and Caril were captured.</p>
        <p>Both Charles and Caril were tried for the murder of Jensen. Caril said she was a hostage, had no part in the murders. She was convicted, sentenced to life, now is appealing. Charles, sentenced to die, has appealed twice unsuccessfully.</p>
        <p>Today, Starkweather sits in an 8-by-12 death-row cell in Nebraska State Penitentiary. Warden Joseph Bovey and Deputy John Greenholtz post guards around the clock. The cell is sparsely furnished; even his glasses are taken away at night. He leaves only for visiting hours, reads a good deal, sketches, talks to the chaplain, read the Bible. Scheduled to die March 27, his sole hope now is a last-ditch reprieve.</p>

        <p>Gunfire: Slayer Starkweather's chilling self-portrait</p>
        <h4>THE CRIMINAL MIND:
        <br></br>
        <b>This Boy Killed Eleven</b></h4>
        <p>His fellow school kids used to call him "Bantam Red Head" when he longed to be "Dead Eye Charlies." He walked with a swagger that gave his short bowed legs an exaggerated curve. His head hung low; he kept his eyes on the ground. He had no money, few friends, no regular job.</p>
        <p>On Dec. 1 1957, this 19-year old boy, Charles Starkweather of Lincoln, Neb., killed Robert Colvert, a gas-station attendant. Fifty days later, Starkweather and his 14-year-old girl friend, Caril Ann Fugate, set out on a murderous trail from Lincoln to Douglas, Wyo., that lasted eight days and left ten other persons dead. For his shoking crimes, Starkweather was executed on June 25, 1959. Caril Fugate was sentenced to life in the Nebraska Women's Reformatory.</p>
        <p>In the past three years, psychiatrists and crime experts have tried to probe the secrets beneath Starkweather's behavior. The latest is Dr. James Melvin Reinhardt, criminology professor at the University of Nebraska, who spet 30 hours interviewing Starkweather in the penitentiary before and after his trial. His book, published last week, "The Murderous Trail of Charles Starkweather," (Charles C. Thomas. $5.75), is the most perceptive report on the strange nature of this young chain-killer.</p>        
        <p>"Charles Starkweather was no ordinary criminal," writes Dr. Reinhardt. "He did not inherit the murderous pattern that cast a horrible shadow over his own family, and those of his innocent victims. He belonged to no hoodlum gangs: he was not a sex maniac, he had no court record. Yet before he was 20, he had murdered eleven people."</p>
        <p>The youth's troubles began on his first day at school, the criminologist reports. In Starkweather's own words: "The kids picked on me . . . they made fun of my bowed legs and my sppeck [he stammered] . . . This brought on a bad mood. I would just sit motionless, in one place, in a gloomy manner. I built up a hatred as hard as iron."</p>
        <p>When Starkweather quit school on finishing ninth grade, "his sickening discontent had spread," writes Dr. Reinhardt. "His ego was defeated and empty; he imagined himself rejected by society. Life was worthless."</p>
        <p>Apparently it never occurred to the forlorn lad that " he might attain position and power by honest toil." He showed artistic talent, Reinhardt writes. "But only while awaiting executions, did he work on his drawings" (see picture).</p>
        <p>Fantasy Fire: Young Starkweather had one real talent, the criminologist points out. He could use a gun. Here was his ego's answer to his gnawing sense of failure. "I love guns," he told Reinhardt. "They give me a feeling of power that nothing else can match."</p>
        <p>When he first began to play with a gun, Charles said, he had no intention of becoming a mass killer. Nevertheless, he spent hours re-enacting in his imagination killings he had seen in movies and on TV; he drew the gun against the reflection of himself in the mirror.</p>
        <p>"All the time, Charles' imagination was oving him into a position of real murder. Imaginary people were prostrate at his feet to his intense satisfaction," says Dr. Reinhardt. "The time came when his inner ego demands could no longer be contained in a world of fantasy."</p>
        <p>Then Caril Ann Fugate, a pert teenager, came into his life. "I felt better after being with Caril; I belonges to someone. I never met a 14-year-old girl who knowed so much; she could talk like a grown-up woman.</p>
        <p>"We had to be together," the young killer told Dr. Reinhardt. "I wanted to take her far away." The need for money for the trip drove Starkweather to his first murder. The 50 days between the filling-station killing and the first day of the chain-murders was a restless, impoatient interlude. "Everything was closing in on Caril and me; she was having trouble at home. Everyone was against us; so we had to shoot our way out."</p>
        <p>In the next week, driving a succession of stolen cars, the youthful murderer killed Caril's mother, stepfather, and baby half-sister, along with a farmer, a Lincoln businessman, his wife and their maid, a teen-age couple, and a salesman. When his gun was empty, and Wyoming police officers held Starkweather fast, he could only say: "These people got in our way. So I had to kill them all."</p>
        <p>Was it Paranoia? Psychologists called Charles Starkweather legally and mentally sane. In his opinion, Dr. Reinhardt does not wholly agree. "His consuming hatred and morbid suspicions were not faked," he said. "Much of his habitual behavior in sessions with me, was definitely paranoiac."</p>
        <p>During the interviews Reinhardt saw not a single sign of remorse in the young killer. "Why did this hppen to me?" he demanded. "Why couldn't I find the life I heard people talk about? I haven't eaten in a high-class restaurant; I never seen the New York Yankees play; I've never been to Los Angeles." He shrugged: "It doesn't matter . . . I guess I never knowed about happiness no how."</p>
        <p>When arrested in Wyoming, Charles Starkweather wrote to his father: "Dad, I am not sorry for what I did, cause for the first time me and Caril had more fun . . . All we wanted to do was to get away together . . ."</p>

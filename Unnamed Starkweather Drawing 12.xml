            <figDesc>Colored pencil drawing of a boy looking off to the left side. He has red hair and is wearing a green shirt, probably a self-portrait of Starkweather as a kid. He's standing in front of a board with drawings done by kids pinned to it, something that is often found in elementary schools. The right corner of the drawing is signed by Charles Starkweather. Back of the drawing is blank.</figDesc>

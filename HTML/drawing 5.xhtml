        <h1>Unnamed Starkweather Drawing 5</h1>
        
        <p>Scan of a pencil drawing. Depicts three figures in the midst of motion, as well as the left headlight of a vehicle. The bottom left figure’s head and shoulders are only shown. This figure is holding and firing what appears to be a shotgun. They are firing into the far right figure. The far right figure is slouched as it appears they’ve been struck with a bullet. The right figure appears to be a man wearing a suit. The middle figure appears to be walking away from the right figure, with their back to the viewer. They appear to be holding a shotgun in both hands. Back of the scan is blank.

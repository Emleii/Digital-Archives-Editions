      <h1>Unnamed Starkweather Drawing 19</h1>      
      
      
      
      Pencil drawing of a man, crouching with one knee on the ground and a rifle in his
      hand. The rifle is pointed upwards, but is not in position to shoot. He wears glasses
      and is probably a self-portrait of Starkweather. Back of the drawing is blank.

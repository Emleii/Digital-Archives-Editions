      Scan of a pencil drawing. Man sits in a chair in front of a desk and what looks to
      be a barred window of some sort. He has a pencil in his hand, writing or drawing on
      a piece of paper. He also hold something is his mouth, probably a cigarette because
      of his hand placement and how there are the faint lines of smoke around his head.
      Most likely a self-portrait of Starkweather writing a letter or working on one of
      his drawings. Back of the scan is blank

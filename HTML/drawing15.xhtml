       <h1>Unnamed Starkweather Drawing 15</h1>     
      
      
      
      Colored pencil drawing of a man leaning against the car. The man is probably Starkweather
      himself. He's smoking a cigarette and has Starkweather's red hair and glasses, also
      sporting the James dean look. The car is green with a red interior and there's a blue
      sky behind them. On the bottom right corner is Charles Starkweather's signature in
      red pen. The back of the drawing is blank.

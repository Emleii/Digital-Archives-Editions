      <h1>Unnamed Starkweather Drawing 20</h1>      
      
      
      
      Pencil drawing of a head of a woman, most likely of Caril Ann Fugate. The head is
      bent forward slightly and turned towards the observer. Her hair is dark and curles
      in a short hairstyle. It looks like he is wearing lipstick. There is a little shading
      in the face and her eyes look a little crazed, wide with the pupils not quite matching
      up. Her mouth is open as if she is about to talk. Back of the drawing has a circled
      five in the bottom left corner.

      <h1>Unnamed Starkweather Drawing 18</h1>      
      
      
      
      Pencil drawing of two disembodied heads: one woman and one man. The head of the woman
      is slightly above the head of the man and is smaller. She looks to her left. She looks
      as if she's wearing lipstick and has her hair curled. She's also wearing sunglasses.
      The man has his head bent down to his left. There are furrows on his forehead, he's
      wearing glasses, and his eyes are closed. Back of the drawing is blank.

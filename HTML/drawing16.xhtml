       <h1>Unnamed Starkweather Drawing 16</h1>     
      
      
      
      Pencil drawing of a man and a woman in a car, likely a self-portrait of Stakweather
      and Fugate. The figures have little detail or depth and are more of an outline. The
      eyes are only implied by eyebrows. The car also is not fully drawn and the front is
      open-faced so that you can see the full length of the figures. The man sits at the
      wheel of the car, his foot on what seems to be on the gas pedal. The woman sits with
      one arm across the back of the seat and the other holding a rifle across her lap.
      Back of the drawing is blank.
